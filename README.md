# Large-Language-model-and-graph-search-by-using-causal-models
Using the Tennessee Eastman Process(TEP) Simulation Dataset as our study's foundation dataset. 
Using large language models (LLMs), this dissertation suggests an innovative framework for comprehensive causal graph discovery. Our method leverages breadth-first search (BFS) to reduce the number of pairwise queries to linear, improving efficiency compared to earlier LLM-based approaches that require an increasing number of queries. Observational data can also be added to the system to enhance performance. Our approach is successful and efficient in identifying relationships between variables, as demonstrated by state-of-the-art findings on real-world causal graphs. We examine how LLMs can be used to provide diagnostic criteria, analyse control system overviews, and recommend fault techniques. We additionally examine graph search techniques for identification and component relationship modelling. We assess the diagnostic efficiency and accuracy of the framework by applying the data collected from the Tennessee Eastman Process (TEP) Simulation Dataset.
